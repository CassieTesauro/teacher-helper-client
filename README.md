# Overview
Every day, teachers pull small groups of students daily to work on different academic and behavioral skills.  The topics and participants of these groups can change day to day as needed.  Currently, most teachers use paper-filled binders to organize these sessions. Due to the ever-changing group members and taught skills, paper and pencil management is very inefficient. With Teacher Helper, teachers can easily view and change their small group instruction plans.  Teacher Helper is the second in a series of apps meant to save teachers time and help them stay organized. This CRUD app is designed to be easy to navigate for teachers with limited technology experience.  After logging in, teachers can view and update their student roster as well as create, view, update, and delete small group meetings from their schedule.
